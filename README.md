# PythonIntegrityCheck

This is my first test project on github, it is a default template for a python integrity checker using stored hash and comparing it with a file

I will not be adding updated to this project, as it is intended just to further my knowledge in python, any recommendations or things I oculd improve on would be great. 

Thank for viewing, and if this is useful to you somehow, you could openly use the code.
