# PythonIntegrityCheck

This is my first test project on github, it is a default template for a python integrity checker using stored hash and comparing it with a file

I will not be adding updated to this project, as it is intended just to further my knowledge in python, any recommendations or things I oculd improve on would be great. 

Thank for viewing, and if this is useful to you somehow, you could openly use the code. 

Notice: if you would like to intend to use this, you should not be storing these hashes on the system, or at least not in the same directory as the .py file is found. You should instead store these hashes externally, or if you can't then store them somewhere else, perhaps as a registry key or something.  

Additional Notice: This program is NOT secure, and should only be used as a template
